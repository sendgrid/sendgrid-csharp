# How To Edit the SendGrid Docs via GitHub

Editing the SendGrid Documentation is easy!
If you see an error, a typo, or have something you would like to add, you can make your suggestion via GitHub, the content management system we use for the Docs. Once you have submitted your suggestion, the Docs team can easily review it before it is published to the Docs website.

To make changes to any page on https://sendgrid.com/docs, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the page you would like to edit and click **Edit this page** at the bottom of the page.

This will take you to the sendgrid.com/docs GitHub repository, or repo. This is where our docs pages are stored.

2. If you do not already have a GitHub account, you will have to create one in order to suggest a change. Click the Sign up link in the upper right-hand corner to create an account. Enter your username, password, and email address. If you are an employee of SendGrid, please use your full name with your GitHub account and enter SendGrid as your company so we can easily identify you.

Once you are viewing a Docs page in GitHub, click the pencil icon to begin editing:

3. Once you have made your changes, you will be given the option of creating a new branch in a Pull Request. This is a request to create a copy, or branch, of the original Docs but with your changes. Once your changes are approved, your branch will then be merged back into the original. 


4. To create a Pull Request, you’ll have to fill out a Commit Changes form. Follow the built-in template and provide information about any changes you have made to the page. Leave the default branch option and name.


5. When done, click **Propose file change**. The Docs Team will be notified of your request. Once we are able to review the change, we will publish it to the site!


> All contributors to the SendGrid docs repo need to sign a CLA before their changes can be merged. 

The SendGrid Documentation must follow certain style guidelines. While many of these guidelines are not applicable to small changes, it is important to make sure that our Docs are:

* Concise
* Accurate
* Organized
* Scannable

Docs contributors should strive for a professional and “coach-like” tone of voice. Avoid vague language, and get right to the point. Long and overly complicated explanations are not helpful to a user who wants a quick-and-easy answer. Please don’t be intimidated by these style guidelines. They don’t apply to most minor changes, and more significant changes will be reviewed and edited by the Docs Team before publication.

If you are making substantial edits or are adding more than a paragraph of new content, feel free to refer to [SendGrid’s Style Guide](https://github.com/sendgrid/docs/blob/develop/styleguide.md).
