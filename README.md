[![BuildStatus](https://travis-ci.org/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp)

Please see our announcement regarding [breaking changes](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp/issues/317). Your support is appreciated!

**This library allows you to quickly and easily use the SendGrid Web API v3 via C# with .NET.**

Version 9.X.X+ of this library provides full support for all SendGrid [Web API v3](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/index.html) endpoints, including the new [v3 /mail/send](https://sendgrid.com/blog/introducing-v3mailsend-sendgrids-new-mail-endpoint).

This library represents the beginning of a new path for SendGrid. We want this library to be community driven and SendGrid led. We need your help to realize this goal. To help make sure we are building the right things in the right order, we ask that you create [issues](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) or simply upvote or comment on existing issues or pull requests.

Please browse the rest of this README for further detail.

We appreciate your continued support, thank you!

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- .NET version 4.5.2 and higher
- .NET Core 1.0 and higher
- .NET Standard 1.3 support
- [A SendGrid account](https://sendgrid.com/free?source=sendgrid-csharp)

## Setup Environment Variables

Update the development Environment with your [SENDGRID_API_KEY](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys). For example, in Windows 10, please review [this thread](http://superuser.com/questions/949560/how-do-i-set-system-environment-variables-in-windows-10).

## Install Package

To use SendGrid in your C# project, you can either <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp.git">download the SendGrid C# .NET libraries directly from our Github repository</a> or, if you have the NuGet package manager installed, you can grab them automatically.

```
PM> Install-Package SendGrid
```

Once you have the SendGrid libraries properly referenced in your project, you can include calls to them in your code.
For sample implementations, check the [.NET Core Example](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp/tree/master/ExampleCoreProject) and the [.NET 4.5.2 Example](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp/tree/master/ExampleNet45Project) folders.

## Dependencies

- Please see the [.nuspec file](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp/tree/master/nuspec).

# Quick Start

## Hello Email

The following is the minimum needed code to send an simple email:

```csharp
using SendGrid;
using SendGrid.Helpers.Mail;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Example
{
    internal class Example
    {
        private static void Main()
        {
            Execute().Wait();
        }

        static async Task Execute()
        {
            var apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("NAME_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_FOR_YOUR_SENDGRID_KEY");
            var client = new SendGridClient(apiKey);
            var from = new EmailAddress("test@example.com", "Example User");
            var subject = "Hello World from the SendGrid CSharp SDK!";
            var to = new EmailAddress("test@example.com", "Example User");
            var plainTextContent = "Hello, Email!";
            var htmlContent = "<strong>Hello, Email!</strong>";
            var msg = MailHelper.CreateSingleEmail(from, to, subject, plainTextContent, htmlContent);
            var response = await client.SendEmailAsync(msg);
        }
    }
}
```

For more advanced cases, you can build the SendGridMessage object yourself, following is the minimum required settings:

```csharp
using SendGrid;
using SendGrid.Helpers.Mail;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Example
{
    internal class Example
    {
        private static void Main()
        {
            Execute().Wait();
        }

	    static async Task Execute()
        {
            var apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("NAME_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_FOR_YOUR_SENDGRID_KEY");
            var client = new SendGridClient(apiKey);
            var msg = new SendGridMessage()
            {
                From = new EmailAddress("test@example.com", "DX Team"),
                Subject = "Hello World from the SendGrid CSharp SDK!",
                PlainTextContent = "Hello, Email!",
                HtmlContent = "<strong>Hello, Email!</strong>"
            };
            msg.AddTo(new EmailAddress("test@example.com", "Test User"));
            var response = await client.SendEmailAsync(msg);
        }
    }
}
```

You can find an example of all of the email features [here](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-csharp/blob/master/tests/SendGrid.Tests/Integration.cs#L79).

## General v3 Web API Usage

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using SendGrid;

namespace Example
{
    internal class Example
    {
        private static void Main()
        {
            Execute().Wait();
        }

        static async Task Execute()
        {
            var apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("NAME_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_FOR_YOUR_SENDGRID_KEY");
            var client = new SendGridClient(apiKey);
            var queryParams = @"{
                'limit': 100
            }";
            var response = await client.RequestAsync(method: SendGridClient.Method.GET,
                                                     urlPath: "suppression/bounces",
                                                     queryParams: queryParams);
	    }
    }
}
```
## Web Proxy

```csharp
var apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("NAME_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_FOR_YOUR_SENDGRID_KEY");
var proxy = new WebProxy("http://proxy:1337");
var client = new SendGridClient(proxy, apiKey);
```
