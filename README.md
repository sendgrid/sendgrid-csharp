[SendGridPlus](http://github.com/AdvancedREI/SendGrid-csharp)
=================

SendGridPlus is a client library for interacting with SendGrid's Mail and Event APIs. It is a refactored and enhanced version of the SendGrid package, and is being released because SendGrid has not kept the NuGet package in sync with their repository.

AdvancedREI has refactored this library to logically support multiple APIs, and enhanced it with Event processing, to let you easily leverage the Event API in your own code.


Quick start
-----------

Install the NuGet package: `Install-Package SendGridPlus`, clone the repo: `git clone git://github.com/advancedrei/sendgrid-csharp.git`, or  [download the latest release](https://github.com/advancedrei/sendgrid-csharp/zipball/master).

The major differences between this and the official library is that the default namespace is now `SendGrid` instead of `SendGridMail`, and you get a new instance by calling `Mail.GetInstance();` instead of  `SendGrid.GenerateInstance();`

You can also easily get single or batched Events from an MVC controller with the following example:

    public class SendGridController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            var events = Events.GetEvents(Request.InputStream);
            events.ForEach(c => DoSomething(c));
            return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.OK);
        }
    }

If you are using the new `AddUniqueIdentifiers()` method on the Mail object, you can also retrieve those values by inheriting from EventData in a custom class. Just make sure the property is the same name as your identifier, and call this code instead:

`var events = Events.GetEvents<YourEventDataType>(Request.InputStream);`
You will then get back a List of your custom objects, instead of a `List<EventData>`.
